&nbsp; &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; clientHold &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; An &nbsp; object &nbsp; on &nbsp; clientHold &nbsp; is &nbsp; not &nbsp; published &nbsp; in &nbsp; the &nbsp; DNS &nbsp; zone &nbsp; file. &nbsp; If &nbsp; it &nbsp; is &nbsp; a &nbsp; domain, &nbsp; it &nbsp; will &nbsp; not &nbsp; resolve &nbsp; until &nbsp; the &nbsp; clientHold &nbsp; status &nbsp; is &nbsp; removed. &nbsp; This &nbsp; status &nbsp; may &nbsp; be &nbsp; added &nbsp; to &nbsp; an &nbsp; object &nbsp; by &nbsp; either &nbsp; the &nbsp; registrar &nbsp; who &nbsp; sponsors &nbsp; the &nbsp; object &nbsp; or &nbsp; the &nbsp; registry &nbsp; administrator. &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; serverHold &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; This &nbsp; status &nbsp; is &nbsp; the &nbsp; same &nbsp; as &nbsp; the &nbsp; clientHold &nbsp; status &nbsp; in &nbsp; that &nbsp; it &nbsp; prevents &nbsp; the &nbsp; domain &nbsp; from &nbsp; being &nbsp; published &nbsp; into &nbsp; the &nbsp; DNS &nbsp; zone &nbsp; file; &nbsp; however, &nbsp; it &nbsp; can &nbsp; only &nbsp; be &nbsp; added &nbsp; to &nbsp; an &nbsp; object &nbsp; by &nbsp; the &nbsp; registry &nbsp; administrator. &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; pendingTransfer &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; Depending &nbsp; on &nbsp; the &nbsp; rules &nbsp; of &nbsp; your &nbsp; particular &nbsp; registry, &nbsp; the &nbsp; pendingTransfer &nbsp; status &nbsp; may &nbsp; be &nbsp; needed. &nbsp; This &nbsp; status &nbsp; is &nbsp; used &nbsp; to &nbsp; describe &nbsp; an &nbsp; object &nbsp; that &nbsp; is &nbsp; currently &nbsp; being &nbsp; transferred. &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; pendingDelete &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; This &nbsp; status &nbsp; is &nbsp; given &nbsp; to &nbsp; an &nbsp; object &nbsp; when &nbsp; it &nbsp; is &nbsp; scheduled &nbsp; for &nbsp; deletion, &nbsp; as &nbsp; long &nbsp; as &nbsp; it &nbsp; is &nbsp; not &nbsp; deleted &nbsp; within &nbsp; the &nbsp; initial &nbsp; grace &nbsp; period &nbsp; given. &nbsp; The &nbsp; object &nbsp; remains &nbsp; pendingDelete &nbsp; for &nbsp; a &nbsp; period &nbsp; to &nbsp; avoid &nbsp; deletion &nbsp; mistakes, &nbsp; as &nbsp; it &nbsp; is &nbsp; easy &nbsp; to &nbsp; reverse &nbsp; the &nbsp; deletion &nbsp; process &nbsp; during &nbsp; this &nbsp; time. &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; ok &nbsp; <br &#47;><br />
&nbsp; This &nbsp; status &nbsp; is &nbsp; given &nbsp; to &nbsp; an &nbsp; object &nbsp; when &nbsp; no &nbsp; other &nbsp; status &nbsp; attributes &nbsp; apply. &nbsp; This &nbsp; status &nbsp; cannot &nbsp; be &nbsp; added &nbsp; or &nbsp; removed, &nbsp; except &nbsp; by &nbsp; the &nbsp; server.&nbsp;&nbsp;<&#47;p></p>
