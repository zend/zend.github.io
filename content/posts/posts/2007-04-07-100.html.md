<div class="nav">
  "Studies have shown that proper use of ergonomics in the work place can significantly reduce the risk of bodily injury, including carpal tunnel. Currently, carpal tunnel accounts for 50% of work-related injury and a significant portion can be attributed to repetitive motion disorder caused by frequent mouse use. Wrist injury can be prevented or reduced by utilizing a properly designed ergonomic mouse pad. [With the chest rest,] wrist is <br />supported by the valley in between the two gelatin mounds.

### 7. Click Away with the Boob Mouse

<span class="inline left"><img class="image teaser" height="219" src="http://www.americaninventorspot.com/files/images/SexyMouse.jpg" width="250" alt="" /></span> I don&#8217;t know what the merchant is saying since I can&#8217;t read Japanese. But according to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/busty-mouse-195604.php" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a>:

"Now not only can you have a Busty Mousepad, you can have a busty mouse to go along with it. The mouse has two buttons and a scrollwheel&mdash;which part of a woman&#8217;s anatomy is that&mdash;and costs only $4.99 (1000 Yen). Though, the breasts look more like eyeballs than breasts, so it&#8217;s not *that* erotic. 

### 6. Fry Up Eggs with the Boob Egg Mold
