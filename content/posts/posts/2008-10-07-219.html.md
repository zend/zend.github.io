This is a modified version of slimbox, with a iframe support added.

Find:

> this.eventPosition = this.position.bind(this);

Add a new line after it:

> this.body = top.document.body;

Find: 

> .injectInside(document.body)

Replace with:

> .injectInside(this.body)

Done.

Modified slimbox.js file can be download here:
